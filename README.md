| Bike Shop     |  I am working on this project to demonstrate my understanding of SQL.                                                 |
|               |  I downloaded this dataset and ER diagram from Kaggle and created my own database on pgAdmin.                         |
|               |   After creating the tables and importing the data through CSV files, I thought of a variety of common questions      |
|               |   that may be asked of someone who is responsible for querying a database. I then proceeded to write the queries to   |
|               |   retrieve the results and provided my explanations. Within this repository, I have included: the original dataset    |
|               |   in CSV format, ER diagram, a file to show me creating the tables and the various queries and results of those       |
|               |   queries.                                                                                                            |
